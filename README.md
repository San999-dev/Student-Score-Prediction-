# 📘 Student Score Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts students' final exam scores using machine learning.  
The model is trained on features such as **hours studied**, **attendance**, and **past grades**, helping educators identify students who may need academic support.

 🗂️ Dataset
The dataset contains the following sample columns:
- `Hours_Studied`
- `Attendance`
- `Past_Grades`
- `Final_Score` (target variable)

---
 ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python 🐍
   
- Pandas & NumPy (data processing)
   
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (visualization)
  
- Scikit-learn (ML models & evaluation)  

---

🚀 Workflow
1. Data loading & preprocessing
 
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   
3. Feature scaling

4. Model training (Linear Regression / Random Forest)
 
5. Model evaluation (R² Score, Mean Squared Error)
   
  
6. Predicting new student scores  

---

 📊 Model Performance
 
- R² Score: *example 0.85*
  
- MSE: *example 12.4*
  

*(Update with your results after training the model)*
